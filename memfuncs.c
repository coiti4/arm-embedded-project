memcpy

Copies the values of num bytes from the location pointed to by 
source directly to the memory block pointed to by destination.

The underlying type of the objects pointed to by both the source 
and destination pointers are irrelevant for this function; 
The result is a binary copy of the data.

The function does not check for any terminating null character 
in source - it always copies exactly num bytes.

To avoid overflows, the size of the arrays pointed to by both 
the destination and source parameters, shall be at least num bytes, 
and should not overlap (for overlapping memory blocks, 
memmove is a safer approach).

memcmp

Compare two blocks of memory

Compares the first num bytes of the block of memory pointed by ptr1 to the first

Notice that, unlike strcmp, the function does not stop comparing after finding a
